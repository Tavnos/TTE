# TTE

Translation Transcription and Evaluation (TTE)
(Examples in pictures below)
of DNA, mRNA and Peptides with BLOSUM62, 
Polarity, Weight, class, hydropathy, 
and few extras such as matching DNA codon 
(sense antisense), triple and single char name 

This tool is made for an ideal and fast bio-chem analysis,
of organic molecules such as DNA, mRNA, Amino acids, and
understand their function, especially peptide synthesis. 
Protein folding will be a complementary part coming soon.
There is thereby two ways of using this program repeatedly 
for now and with quite the precision and speed, as you can
paste any sequence, press enter, copy desired output, press
enter again, paste, enter and repeat.

DNA/mRNA translation and evaluation with:
 - Total amount of peptides produced by translation
 - Distributed and total weight, and BLOSUM62 score
 - Additional statistics such as polarity and chargeâ€¦
 
DNA configuration prediction of Peptide / Amino acid chains:
 - Linear arrengement from chronological iteration of configuration.
 - Supplementary configuration from random prediction.

More refinements will be coming soon such as: 
 - Protein folding estimation and statistics.
 - Executables for Windows and Linux
 - DNA GANs for intuitional optimisation.
 - Fancier GUI, French and Danish translation. 

Enjoy!

Big credit to everyone that provided 
an amaizing and incomensurable ammount 
of knowledge from Wikipedia, Python3, 
and their outstanding community!
